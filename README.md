# Counting the number of descents in teleporting parking functions TP(n,n-1)

Parking functions are a very interesting mathematical object that among other things (simulate priority queues)[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012365X99900857?via%3Dihub], meaning that understanding these objects better can help us improve communications betweek computers.

In this repository a way of counting the (descents)[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019688580900075X] in (teleporting parking functions)[https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07658] using generative functions is given.

The Python code allows to check empirically that at least in the first parking functions the results are correct for the first natural numbers.

Furthermore, this is supported by the theory in the .pdf file. Where the results are proven correct for every natural number.
